            Rexine is made by applying a coating of PVC on the cotton cloth. The fabric is used in airproof and waterproof packing and decoration. The fabric is being used for making seat covers and railway interiors for years. This artificial leather cloth fabric is a durable, soft, and long-lasting.
            Used as a bookbinding material and upholstery covering, Rexine was also widely used in trimming and upholstering the interiors of motor vehicles produced by British car manufacturers beginning in the 1920s, and the interiors of railway carriages, its cost being around a quarter that of leather.
        REXINE was registered as a Trademark in 1899 by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) as leathercloth, i.e. Oil cloth, etc (vinyl materials not having been developed at that time). REXENE is something completely different and
         does not relate to leathercloth, so is an incorrect spelling.
